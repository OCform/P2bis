Before CSS3, this box model was known as W3C box model, in CSS3, it is known as the content-box.

The total width of a box is therefore left-margin + left-border + left-padding + width + right-padding + right-border + right-margin. Similarly, the total height of a box equals top-margin + top-border + top-padding + height + bottom-padding + bottom-border + bottom-margin.

For example, the following CSS code

.myClass {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: solid 10px black;
  margin: 10px;
}

would specify the box dimensions of each block belonging to 'myClass'. Moreover, each such box will have total height 160px and width 260px.

CSS3 introduced the Internet Explorer box model to the standard, known referred to as border-box.[6]
